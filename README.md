# Employee Turnover Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to optimize hiring and retention costs by leveraging a predictive model for employee turnover. Small business owners, spending 40% of their time on non-income generating tasks like hiring, and companies investing 15%-20% of an employee's salary for recruitment, can benefit significantly from this data-driven solution.

## Key Insights
- Average cost of hiring a new employee: $7645
- Average time to fill a position: 52 days
- Companies lose 1%-2.5% of total revenue on onboarding time
- Extensive dataset provided by HR team, including features like Job Involvement, Education, Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Relationship Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance.

## Data Science Approach
Utilizing machine learning techniques, the model predicts which employees are more likely to quit, enabling proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

## Benefits
- Cost Reduction: Minimizing recruitment expenses and onboarding time.
- Time Efficiency: Streamlining the hiring process, reducing the average time to fill a position.
- Talent Retention: Identifying at-risk employees and implementing retention strategies.
